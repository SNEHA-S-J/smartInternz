# Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik

## Project Overview

The "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik" project leverages synthetic airline data from Kaggle to uncover valuable insights using Qlik Sense, a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool. The dataset includes various aspects of airline operations such as passenger information, airport details, flight schedules, and flight statuses. This project aims to help airlines, airports, and related stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

## Key Objectives

- **Optimize Revenue**: Analyze historical ticket sales to identify peak travel times, popular destinations, and effective pricing strategies.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency**: Evaluate flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks.
- **Improve Customer Experience**: Understand customer preferences and satisfaction to enhance service quality, personalize offerings, and create targeted marketing campaigns.

## Technical Architecture

1. **Data Source**: Synthetic airline data from Kaggle (CSV format).
2. **Data Ingestion**: Using Qlik Sense built-in connectors to import data.
3. **Data Processing**: Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation within Qlik Sense.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations created in Qlik Sense.
5. **Analysis**: Utilizing Qlik Sense’s analytical tools to generate insights and actionable reports.

## Problem Definition

### Business Problems Addressed
- **Revenue Leakage**: Identifying and addressing suboptimal revenue generation.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: Detecting inefficiencies in flight operations, passenger handling, and luggage processing.
- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Analyzing customer dissatisfaction and identifying factors to improve the passenger experience.

### Business Requirements
- **Data Integration**: Seamless import of synthetic airline data into Qlik Sense.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Creation of dynamic dashboards for stakeholders to explore insights.
- **Actionable Insights**: Deliver actionable recommendations to support decision-making.

### Literature Survey
A review of related research, including case studies on airline data analysis, revenue management, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction, provides context and establishes best practices for the project.

## Data Collection

### Dataset
The dataset from Kaggle includes:
- **Passenger Information**: Passenger ID, names, gender, age, nationality.
- **Airport Details**: Airport name, country code, country name, continent.
- **Flight Schedules**: Departure dates, arrival airports, pilot names.
- **Flight Status**: Flight statuses such as on-time, delayed, or cancelled.

### Data Connection with Qlik Sense
1. **Open Qlik Sense**: Start Qlik Sense and navigate to the Data Load Editor.
2. **Add Data**: Click "Add Data" and select the CSV file from the dataset.
3. **Load Data**: Import the dataset into Qlik Sense for further processing.

## Data Preparation

1. **Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and address data inconsistencies.
2. **Transformation**: Aggregate data, create calculated fields, and format data for visualization.
3. **Validation**: Ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data before visualizing.

## Data Visualizations

Various visualizations were created to explore and analyze the dataset:
- **Bar Graphs**: Flight status (on-time, delayed, cancelled) by month.
- **Line Charts**: Trends in ticket sales over time.
- **Pie Charts**: Distribution of passenger demographics.

## Dashboard Design

The dashboard was designed with the following considerations:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation with a clean layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Filters, drill-down options, and dynamic updates to enhance user interaction.

## Reporting

### Report Creation
1. **Select Insights**: Highlight key insights and visualizations from the dashboard.
2. **Format Report**: Organize selected insights logically, including explanatory text and context.
3. **Export Report**: Generate reports in a suitable format for distribution.

## Performance Testing

- **Data Rendered**: 97,739 rows of cleaned data.
- **Qlik Sense Script**: A script was added to remove null values from the "Arrival Airport" column.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters were applied to refine insights and create additional columns for further analysis.
- **Visualizations**: 16 different visualizations and graphs were created to provide comprehensive insights into the dataset.
