Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik
Project Overview
The "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik" project leverages synthetic airline data from Kaggle to uncover valuable insights using Qlik Sense, a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool. The dataset includes various aspects of airline operations such as passenger information, airport details, flight schedules, and flight statuses. This project aims to help airlines, airports, and related stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

Key Objectives
Optimize Revenue: Analyze historical ticket sales to identify peak travel times, popular destinations, and effective pricing strategies.

Enhance Operational Efficiency: Evaluate flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks.

Improve Customer Experience: Understand customer preferences and satisfaction to enhance service quality, personalize offerings, and create targeted marketing campaigns.

Technical Architecture
Data Source: Synthetic airline data from Kaggle (CSV format).

Data Ingestion: Using Qlik Sense built-in connectors to import data.

Data Processing: Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation within Qlik Sense.

Visualization: Interactive dashboards and visualizations created in Qlik Sense.

Analysis: Utilizing Qlik Sense’s analytical tools to generate insights and actionable reports.

Problem Definition
Business Problems Addressed
Revenue Leakage: Identifying and addressing suboptimal revenue generation.

Operational Inefficiencies: Detecting inefficiencies in flight operations, passenger handling, and luggage processing.
